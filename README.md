# Tokio Frames

This code is copied and extended from [tokio-serde](https://github.com/carllerche/tokio-serde). It supports [prost](https://github.com/danburkert/prost) and [rkyv](https://github.com/djkoloski/rkyv).

## Why do I do it?

I just want to learn how to implement data structure with many type parameters. Though most of the code is copied from tokio-serde, I actually tried to copy line by line and tweak it to see what could happen.

## How to use it

See tests.

Have fun with this crate!
